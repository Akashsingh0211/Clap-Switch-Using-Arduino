# Clap-Switch-Using-Arduino
A Clap Switch using Arduino and a Sound Sensor is a simple project that allows you to turn on or off a device (like an LED or any appliance) by detecting claps or loud sounds. Hereâ€™s a basic breakdown of how the project works:
Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
Sound Sensor Module (e.g., KY-038 or any compatible sound sensor)
